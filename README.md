The code and data stored in this repository are producing Figures 1 and 2 of the journal article ["Evidence of wildfire in the British Isles during the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition: 
Revealing spatiotemporal patterns and controls"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pgeola.2020.05.001).

The figures are a synthesis of previously published charcoal data for 238 sites in the British Isles. The data collated demonstrate the widespread occurrence of charcoal in sediments that 
span the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT; c. 17âˆ’8.3 ka cal. BP) for the first time.
